running-race: running-race.sb2
--------------

Click Start to see the cats have a race. The first one to the finish line wins! Try it multiple times, and try to guess each time which cat will win.

This project is a progression from the scrolling background in the scratch-intro repo. In the introduction project, the scrolling background is acheived by linking to together a series of sprites. In this project, a single background sprite is used, which clones itself to create infinite scrolling. This is combined with a background to create a smooth scrolling effect.

The project also explores randomness, broadcasts and events.

ball-dynamics: rolling-ball.sb2 bouncing-ball.sb2 
--------------

The rolling ball game demonstrates simple ball dynamics by showing you how to make a ball roll forward and back across the stage.

The bouncing ball game demonstrates more complex ball dynamics by showing you how to make a ball bounce off the edges of the stage and carry on in the correct direction.
