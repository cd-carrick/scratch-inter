This project is a progression from the scrolling background in the scratch-intro repo. In the introduction project, the scrolling background is acheived by linking to together a series of sprites. In this project, a single background sprite is used, which clones itself to create infinite scrolling. This is combined with a background to create a smooth scrolling effect.

The project also explores randomness, broadcasts and events.
